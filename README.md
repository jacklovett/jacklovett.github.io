This is my personal portfolio/CV website.

It is written in React with Typescript.

It can be run with:

`yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Take a look, see what I have been up to. Let me know what you think, it is always a work in progress.
